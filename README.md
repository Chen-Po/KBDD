# KBDD: a knowledge-based and data-driven method for genetic network construction

KBDD is a Python library designed to construct genetic networks. The KBDD algorithm can integrate knowledge-based (pathway analysis) and data-driven (statistical modeling) methods. It can summarize the network structure using available biological information, explore network properties, and generate a final ensemble network. 

This repository contains code to reproduce the results of simulation and applications in
