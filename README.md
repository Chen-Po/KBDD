# KBDD: a knowledge-based and data-driven method for genetic network construction

## Description
KBDD is a Python library designed to construct genetic networks. The KBDD algorithm can integrate knowledge-based (pathway analysis) and data-driven (statistical modeling) methods. It can summarize the network structure using available biological information, explore network properties, and generate a final ensemble network. 

## Install from PyPi
'''
pip install KBDD
